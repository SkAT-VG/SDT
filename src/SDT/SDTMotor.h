@defgroup motor SDTMotor.h: Combustion engines
From a mechanical point of view, an internal combustion engine converts chemical
energy into kinetic energy by means of a series of controlled explosions. From
an acoustical point of view, the previously described setup is basically a set
of resonating pipes, excited by the explosions happening in the combustion
chambers. Resonances happening inside intake pipes, cylinders, exhaust
collectors, exhaust pipe, exhaust muffler and final outlet are simulated by
means of digital waveguides, whose inputs, lengths and feedback gains are
controlled by a physical model of the engine operation cycle representing the
behavior of the engine block. Four mechanical components are simulated: Piston
motion, fuel ignition, intake valves operation and exhaust valves operation. The
model provides also a simulation of exhaust backfiring, a phenomenon which
occurs especially in sports or muscle cars, where the very rich fuel mixture
sometimes doesn't burn completely in the cylinders and self ignites later in the
hotter parts of the exhaust system.
