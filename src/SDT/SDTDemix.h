/** @file SDTDemix.h
@defgroup demix SDTDemix.h: Transient/tonal/residual components separator
This algorithm looks for vertical and horizontal structures in the spectrogram
to separate an arbitrary audio signal into its percussive (transients), harmonic
(sustained tones) and residual (noise) components. It is based on a technique
called structure tensor, frequently used in image processing for edge and corner
detection or to estimate the orientation of an object.

The structure tensor can be thought as a smoothed gradient
of the spectrogram, which describes the consistency and direction of changes in
the energy content of each bin. The anisotropy (consistency) and direction
descriptors extracted from the structure tensor are used to classify the
spectrogram bins into three categories: Bins which do not exhibit a particular
gradient direction (low anisotropy) become part of the residual, noisy
component; Bins which tend to have a vertical orientation (high anisotropy, high
direction) are included in the percussive component; Bins with a mostly
horizontal orientation (high anisotropy, low direction) fall into the harmonic
component.

This percussive/harmonic/residual separation is suitable to separate attacks,
decays and noise from a musical signal, or to isolate myoelastic (percussive),
phonatory (harmonic) and turbulent (noisy) activities from a vocal signal. In
particular, the algorithm can be used as a preprocessing step to improve the
results of the myoelastic detector, pitch tracker and spectral moments extractor
present in the analysis part of the Sound Design Toolkit.
