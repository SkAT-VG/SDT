@defgroup gases SDTGases.h: Air turbulence and explosions
Physical models to simulate wooshes, wind gusts and howls, helicopter rotors and
so on. A gas flowing in a more or less constant direction usually doesn't make
any sound by itself, its pressure variations being too slow to fall into the
audible range. Nevertheless, objects obstructing the air flow are likely to
cause turbulence at much higher frequencies, and therefore they do make sounds.
Heavily inspired by the work of Andy Farnell in his book "Designing Sound",
these models render chaotic turbulences through filtered random noise.

This module also includes the simulation of powerful explosions,
as well as objects travelling at supersonic speed
such as rifle bullets or cracking whip tails.
All these phenomena create shock waves,
namely a sudden peak in pressure followed by a negative expansion tail.
Although being highly impulsive events, explosions also generate turbulence and
other kinds of chaotic scattering which yield complex acoustic textures and have
a direct effect on the resulting sound. The SDT explosion model uses a
Friedlander waveform to render the impulsive part, and a Feedback Delay Network
reverb to simulate scattering.

/** @defgroup windflow Turbulence against solid objects
One of the possible sources of turbulence is the impact on a large solid
surface. In this case, turbulence is generated due to the impact of the air
molecules on the surface and to their random change of direction caused by the
irregularities of the surface itself. The resulting sound is modeled through a
bandpass-filtered white noise generator. The center frequency and bandwidth of
the filter are empirically set to fixed values, while the resulting output is
modulated in amplitude according to the velocity of the air flow.

/** @defgroup windcavity Turbulence through hollow cavities
Hollow objects such as pipes, valves, tunnels and doorways
force the air moving inside them to oscillate at their resonant frequencies,
which depend on the size and shape of the cavity itself.
Different modes of resonance can be excited, in a more or less noticeable way,
depending on the speed of the air flowing inside the tube.
For each mode of resonance there is an optimal speed,
which makes the air inside the tube resonate the most.
As the speed increases, resonance gets weaker and weaker
until it breaks up into the next harmonic.
Sound waves trapped in a cylindrical cavity can be effectively simulated using
a simple comb filter, namely a delay line with feedback.
The different excitation of the various harmonics is modeled by a resonant
bandpass filter with a high Q factor, therefore with a narrow band and a high
resonance.
