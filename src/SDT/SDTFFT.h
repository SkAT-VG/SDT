@defgroup fft SDTFFT.h: Fast Fourier Transform
Data structures and functions to perform frequency analysis on signals
by means of the Discrete Fourier Transform and its inverse.
This implementation is based on the iterative version of the Cooley-Tukey
algorithm, works with double precision floating point arithmetic and provides an
optimization for the transformation of real-valued signals.
